# Test files

A few test files are provided to help troubleshoot issues with the app, should
you encounter any. These files are not used by the app itself.

To run a test, from the app root directory, run:

```bash
python -um tests.test_file_name_without_py_extension
```

Example:
```bash
python -um tests.test_led
```
